## Play Online
You can play the game by opening `index.html` in your browser on desktop, mobile, or tablet devices.

## Game Description
- **LSDGB** ("LSD Gummy Bear") is a fast-paced, colorful shooter where you play as a groovy gummy bear fighting off conformity!
- **4:3 Playable Area:** The game action is strictly confined to a central 4:3 area (960x720) within a widescreen 16:9 canvas (1280x720). This ensures the controls never overlap the playfield.
- **Dedicated Sidebars:** The left and right sides of the screen are reserved for the D-pad and fire button, keeping them completely outside the action.
- **Visual Boundaries:** Faint lines mark the edges of the playfield for clarity.
- Convert suits and cops into hippies with your acid vials.
- Collect life gummies to increase your lives. Reach 3 lives to win!
- **Dynamic difficulty**: Your fire rate and enemy spawn rate are tied to your score - the better you do, the faster you shoot and the more enemies spawn!
- **Responsive design**: The game scales to fit any screen size while maintaining the same gameplay experience.

## Controls
- **Desktop:**
  - **Move:** Arrow Keys or WASD
  - **Shoot:** Hold SPACEBAR to auto-shoot vibes
  - **Start/Restart:** Click the button or press ENTER
- **Mobile/Touch:**
  - **Move:** Use the large on-screen circular D-pad (in the left sidebar, outside the playfield). Touch and drag in any direction for smooth 8-way movement. There is no dead zone—movement is active anywhere inside the D-pad. To stop, simply lift your thumb.
